## Summary
The following will explain how to use regex to verify/find Hex Codes in text/programs using /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/. Hex Codes are, in most cases, 6 number/letter strings comprised of two sets of digits/letters for red, green, and blue. In some cases, a Hex Code can be shortened or abbreviated to 3 numbers/letters. We will cover different aspects of how the regex process works and what elements of the statement do what.

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
